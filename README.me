My first attempt at creating a law practice management system (LPMS).

The first step is to create an address book for my clients.
 Name (First, Middle, Last)
 Title
 Address
 Cell
 Work
 Email

Then to create matters for each client.
 Client
 Name
 Description
 Rate

Then to log time spent on each matter.
 Description
 Start time
 End time
 Delta time

Then to export the data to a file that can be easily imported into word.
